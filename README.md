# WheelAdvisor
> Programming project Toegepaste Informatice 2022-2023

## Project Overview

Wheeladvisor is a web application that aims to provide wheelchair users with recommendations for wheelchair-accessible places. The application utilizes a backend built with Express.js and a MariaDB database. The frontend is designed using HTML, CSS, and browser JavaScript to create an interactive user experience. Additionally, an API will be provided to facilitate communication between the frontend and backend, enabling users to make requests by providing essential information such as location, name of the place, and description.

## Features

- **Wheelchair-accessible Place Recommendations:** Wheeladvisor offers a curated list of wheelchair-accessible places based on user preferences and location.
- **Search Functionality:** Users can search for specific places or filter results based on various criteria such as distance, category, or accessibility features.
- **User Profiles:** Registered users can create profiles, and save their favorite places
- **Integration with Mapping Services:** Integration with mapping services like [OpenStreetmaps](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) can provide directions to recommended places from the user's current location.
- **API:** The application provides an API that allows developers to make requests to the backend, retrieving information on wheelchair-accessible places.

## Tech Stack

The project utilizes the following technologies:

- **Backend:** Express.js is used to build the server-side application logic, handle API requests, and interact with the MariaDB database.
- **Database:** MariaDB is employed as the relational database management system for storing and retrieving data related to places, users, reviews, and ratings.
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, and browser JavaScript are used to create an intuitive and visually appealing user interface.
- **API:** The backend provides a RESTful API that can be utilized by the frontend to communicate with the server, making requests for place recommendations, user management, and data retrieval.
